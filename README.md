# Security Vulnerabilities API

This project demonstrates backend security with JWT authentication and role-based access control (RBAC). It allows users to log in, access their profile, and restricts certain routes for admin users. The project is designed to be tested via API testing tools like Postman or cURL, as it doesn't have a frontend attached.
